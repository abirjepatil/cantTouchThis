Simply place your sensor on the item you wich to monitor and show people that they Cant Touch This! 

#Getting Started:

  * If this fails, try to cordova platform remove android, then again cordova platform add android

3. Then run: cordova android build
  * This will check if you have the android SDK installed and ready.

  * At this point, the emulator from the SDK should be fired up, if you have a device plugged in you can even try it on that
