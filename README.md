Cant Touch This is a quick and fun application which uses the Wunderbar Light/Color/Proximity sensor and the relayr Cloud Platform to alert when  your wallet/keys/cello/elephant or anything you can think of has been touched, stolen or moved. Simply place your sensor on the item you wich to monitor and show people that they Cant Touch This! 

#Getting Started:
1. Install Phonegap (http://phonegap.com/)
2. Navigate to the CantTouchThis directory and run: phonegap android build
  * This will check if you have the android SDK installed and ready.
  * It will also install android plugins if missing
  * In case it doesn't work, try phonegap platform add android
3. Simply run: phonegap run android
  * At this point, the emulator from the SDK should be fired up, if you have a device plugged in you can even try it on that
